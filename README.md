==========

Matlab and Python Codes for OLS Learning with Neural Network in Cobweb Model. 

There are two versions of code in this repo.

Two Matlab versions: 
'cobweb_ANN.m' - cobweb model learning with Artificial Neural Network with Linear Activation Function
'cobweb_ANN_2.m' - cobweb model learning with Artificial Neural Network with Sigmoid Activation Function

Two Python versions:
'cobweb_ANN_P.py' - cobweb model learning with Artificial Neural Network with Linear Activation Function
'cobweb_ANN_P_2.py' - cobweb model learning with Artificial Neural Network with Sigmoid Activation Function

All of the codes make use of two data files:

'Shocks_var.txt' - stores exogenous shock for the cobweb model
'w_lag.txt' - stores exogenous and observed variable g (or sometimes called w) for the cobweb model

Since all the codes use these variables, results are comparable.
